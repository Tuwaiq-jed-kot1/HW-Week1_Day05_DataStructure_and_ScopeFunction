# Kotlin Essentials (Data Structure /Scope Functions)
---
The Kotlin assignment has three components
- Practice with Scope Functions.
- Practice with Lists and Sets.
- Practice with Maps.

> Note: You must save your solution as `solution_part1.kt` for Part I, `solution_part2.kt` for Part II, and `solution_part3.kt` for Part III.

## Part I - with Scope Functions.
---
- Create a working exmaple withing 'Let'
- Create a working exmaple withing 'Run'  (Optional to do = Bonus!!)
- Create a working exmaple withing 'Also'  (Optional to do = Bonus!!)

## Part II - Practice with Lists and Sets.
---
- Create a list and access it and print it, then update or add elements to it
- Create a list and access out of its bounds, then manage the array errors safety with 3 different ways
- Create a list then add repetitive and unique elements to it, then convert it to set, then add new elements to it and print the set values

## Part III - Practice with Maps.
---
- Write an asnwer to this question: What are the cases that I need to use the map for??
- In map we can declare the keys and values to be any type; there are no restrictions
- So, need to use the map for example:When I want to register the names of university students with their university number
- What is the difference between immutable and read only variables?
- variables defined with var are mutable(Read and Write)
- variables defined with val are immutable(Read only)
- value of mutable variables can be changed at anytime, while you can not change value of immutable variables.
- Create a map of 20 elements of strings and doubles
