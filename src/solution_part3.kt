// what is map in kotlin
// map is a collection which contains pairs of objects. Map holds the data in the form of pairs which consists
// of a key and a value.
// Map keys are unique and the map holds only one value for each key.
// Kotlin distinguishes between immutable and mutable maps.
// Immutable maps created with mapOf() means these are read-only
// and mutable maps created with mutableMapOf() means we can perform read and write both.


// what the difference between mutable and immutable and read only
//There are two types of variables â€“ mutable and immutable. An immutable variable is one whose value cannot be changed,
// also known as unchangeable or read-only variable. On the other hand the value of the mutable variable can be changed.


// 20 element of map that have string and double
