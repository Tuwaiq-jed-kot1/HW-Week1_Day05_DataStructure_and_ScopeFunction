    - Write an asnwer to this question: What are the cases that I need to use the map for??
     The Map provides key-based access using a type that you specify.
     Keys are unique and identify the values in the map; the values,
     on the other hand, do not need to be unique. In this way,
      Map shares another feature with Set: The keys of a map are guaranteed to be unique,
      just like the elements of a set.

    - What is the difference between immutable and read only variables?
     Mutable means that the variable can be reassigned to a different value after initial assignment
     and To declare a mutable variable, you use the var keyword.

    Read only means that the variable cannot be reset once initialized.
    You should prefer read-only variables to mutable variables whenever possible.
    A read-only variable can be declared with val (instead of var)
